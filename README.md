Welcome page for Warren McQuinn’s GitHub profile site.

## Local preview

From the repo root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000`.

## Customize

- Update the “Say hello” links in `index.html` to point to the right profiles.
- Adjust copy as needed; everything is intentionally static and lightweight.
